I can hear the bells, well, don't you hear 'em chime?
Can't you feel my heartbeat keeping perfect time?
And all because he touched me, he looked at me and stared
Yes, he bumped me, my heart was unprepared
When he tapped me and knocked me off my feet
One little touch, now my life's complete
'Cause when he nudged me, love put me in a fix
Yes, it hit me just like a ton of bricks
Yes, my heart burst, now I know what life's about
One little touch and love's knocked me out

And I can hear the bells, my head is spinning
I can hear the bells, something's beginning
Everybody says that a girl who looks like me
Can't win his love, well, just wait and see
'Cause I can hear the bells, just hear them chiming
I can hear the bells, my temperature's climbing
I can't contain my joy
'Cause I finally found the boy I've been missing
Listen, I can hear the bells

Round one, he'll ask me on a date
And then round two, I'll primp but won't be late
Because round three's when we kiss inside his car
Won't go all the way, but I'll go pretty far
Round four, he'll ask me for my hand
And then round five, we'll book the wedding band
So by round six, Amber, much to your surprise
This heavyweight champion takes the prize
