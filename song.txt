I can hear the bells, well, don't you hear 'em chime?
Can't you feel my heartbeat keeping perfect time?
And all because he touched me, he looked at me and stared
Yes, he bumped me, my heart was unprepared
When he tapped me and knocked me off my feet
One little touch, now my life's complete
'Cause when he nudged me, love put me in a fix
Yes, it hit me just like a ton of bricks
Yes, my heart burst, now I know what life's about
One little touch and love's knocked me out

And I can hear the bells, my head is spinning
I can hear the bells, something's beginning
Everybody says that a girl who looks like me
Can't win his love, well, just wait and see
'Cause I can hear the bells, just hear them chiming
I can hear the bells, my temperature's climbing
I can't contain my joy
'Cause I finally found the boy I've been missing
Listen, I can hear the bells

Round one, he'll ask me on a date
And then round two, I'll primp but won't be late
Because round three's when we kiss inside his car
Won't go all the way, but I'll go pretty far
Round four, he'll ask me for my hand
And then round five, we'll book the wedding band
So by round six, Amber, much to your surprise
This heavyweight champion takes the prize

And I can hear the bells, my ears are ringing
I can hear the bells, the bridesmaids are singing
Everybody says that a guy who's such a gem
Won't look my way, well, the laugh's on them
'Cause I can hear the bells, my father will smile
I can hear the bells as he walks me down the aisle
My mother starts to cry
But I can't see 'cause Link and I are French kissing
Listen, I can hear the bells

I can hear the bells, my head is reeling
I can hear the bells, I can't stop the pealing
Everybody warns that he won't like what he'll see
But I know that he'll look inside of me, yeah
I can hear the bells, today's just the start 'cause
I can hear the bells and 'til death do us part
And even when we die, we'll look down from up above
Remembering the night that we two fell in love
We both will shed a tear
And he'll whisper as we're reminiscing
Listen, I can hear the bells (We can hear the bells)
I can hear the bells (We can hear the bells)
I can hear the bells
